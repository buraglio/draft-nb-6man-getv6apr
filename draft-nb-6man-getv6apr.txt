  IPv6 mechanism for determining source and destination address pairs
                     draft-nb-6man-getv6apr-latest

Abstract

   This provides a comprehensive mechanism for determining a "best use"
   source address / destination address (SA/DA) pair for IPv6
   connections and is intended to be a modernized replacement for
   existing SA/DA algorithms such as socket.getaddrinfo().  Instead of
   the current methodology of returning a list of destination addresses,
   this returns a list of source and destination address pairs, which
   are evaluated based on pre-determined and potentially user defined
   criteria.  This mitigates the problem of the operating system
   choosing an inappropriate source address, as can occur with legacy
   mechanisms.

1.  Introduction

   With the rapid expansion of IPv6 and the building momentum of
   retiring IPv4 as a protocol, the exposure of limits of current
   implementations of IPv6 source and destination address selection has
   become acutely more apparent.  [RFC6724] has frequently been analyzed
   and in many cases deemed in need of a refresh, if only to address
   limits of the emergence of dual-stack and now the removal of IPv4.
   IPv6 by design supports and employs multiple addresses per interface.
   Be cause of this feature, there is necessarily a set of heuristics to
   determine which address to use for a given operation.  Thus far, the
   algorithm has operated well enough to allow for successful
   deployments and operational supportability.  However, it is limited
   and somewhat inconsistent in the overall implementations across
   platforms.  Because of these limited, and with the evolving reliance
   internetwork connectivity, the "always connected" expectation of
   general users, there is a necessary evolution required for continued
   expansion of the IPv6 protocol as it pertains to host source and
   address selection.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   SA: Source Address DA: Destination Address Dual-Stack: Configuration
   of a device network interfaces as to originate and understand both
   IPv4 and IPv6 packets.

3.  Limitations of Current Implementations

   PLACEHOLDER via RFC6724:

   In this implementation architecture, applications use APIs [10] like
   getaddrinfo() that return a list of addresses to the application.
   This list might contain both IPv6 and IPv4 addresses (sometimes
   represented as IPv4-mapped addresses).  The application then passes a
   destination address to the network stack with connect() or sendto().
   the application would then typically try the first address in the
   list, looping over the list of addresses until it finds a working
   address.  In any case, the network layer is never in a situation
   where it needs to choose a destination address from several
   alternatives.
